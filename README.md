Task-Fragmentation
AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragment the functionality into a custom hook that will be reusable through out the app.

My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that

Fragmenting the code into a custom hook and component helps,
1. Separates concerns for cleaner code.
2. Promotes reusability across the app.
3. Abstracts implementation details.
4. Facilitates easier testing.
5. Enhances scalability for future development.
